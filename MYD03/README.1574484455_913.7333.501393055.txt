All files subset to the following area of interest:
GEOLOCATION:
             NorthBound = 35
             SouthBound = 32
             WestBound  = -121
             EastBound  = -116.2

All output will be reprojected as follows:
    Projection = GEO,    ResampleType = bilinear,
All output will be formatted as geoTIFF.
